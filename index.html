      <p>
        Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a
womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a
cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst
days, a poet. He’s probably the last
person on earth you would ever look to
for life advice or expect to see in any
sort of self-help book.
Which is why he’s the perfect placeto start.
Bukowski wanted to be a writer. But
for decades his work was rejected by
almost every magazine, newspaper,
journal, agent, and publisher he
submitted to. His work was horrible,
they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved.
And as the stacks of rejection slips piled
up, the weight of his failures pushed him
deep into an alcohol-fueled depression
that would follow him for most of his
life.
Bukowski had a day job as a letter-
filer at a post office. He got paid shit
money and spent most of it on booze. He
gambled away the rest at the racetrack.
At night, he would drink alone andsometimes hammer out poetry on his
beat-up old typewriter. Often, he’d wake
up on the floor, having passed out the
night before.
